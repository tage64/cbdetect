# Chess Board Detection

This is a collection of attempts to detect chess boards in an image and classify all pieces. There
are scripts for generating data and a broken script for training. The only really working and
supported thing is a script for converting a PDF to HTML and try to recognize all chess boards on
all pages. The locations of the pieces will be written in the HTML file. See `instructions.md` for
how to use that script.
